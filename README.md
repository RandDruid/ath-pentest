# ath-pentest

Patches to Atheros driver kernel modules for pentesting and non-standard usage

## Features in ath.ko

- EEPROM country code override to custom or default (module option)
- All standard channels enabled
- Power maxed to 30
- NO-IR/RADAR removed

## Features in ath9k.ko, ath9k_common.ko, ath9k_htc.ko, ath9k_hw.ko

- Power maxed to 30
- Carrier sense disabled (module option) **NOTE:** this will probably make normal Wi-Fi difficult. I use it only for RF tests.
